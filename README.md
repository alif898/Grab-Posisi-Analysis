Analysis of Grab-Posisi dataset, Southeast Asia’s First Comprehensive GPS Trajectory Dataset, as part of NUS Data Analytics Competition 2022

### Problem Statement
There has been feedback about delays in Grab transport services in both Jakarta and Singapore (late driver arrival → late arrival at destination). This has led to a decrease in customer satisfaction and trust, which might increase customer turnover. Upon further research, it was found that this could be due to inaccurate ETA prediction, bad route planning, or other factors. Using the above dataset of GPS pings, what insights can your team obtain to help Grab alleviate these issues?
